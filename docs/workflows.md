# Workflows

This document specifies implemented and planned user workflows. Their data rules
come from [Domain Model](data-model.md), and their transactions follow
[Persistence](persistence.md).

## Create Goods Type

Status: implemented.

1. User opens Administration.
2. User chooses **Add goods type**.
3. User enters a display name and optional description.
4. The form validates required text and duplicate naming guidance.
5. A review step shows the entered type details and explains that protected fields
   are created automatically.
6. Confirmation creates the goods type and built-in field definitions atomically.
7. Navigation refreshes and opens the new goods type.

Display names do not need to be globally unique, but the UI should warn when an
active type already uses the same normalized name. IDs are generated internally.
User mode persists the result in IndexedDB. Debug mode applies the same workflow
to temporary in-memory data that disappears when the page reloads.

## Add Item

Status: generated fields, image cropping, review, atomic persistence, and listing
are implemented.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A["Open the collection Items view"] --> B["Choose Add item"]
  B --> C["Open modal and load goods type and active fields"]
  C --> D["Render empty form and required markers"]
  D --> E["Edit form values"]
  E --> F{"Required image selected?"}
  F -->|No| G["Choose and crop image"]
  G --> H["Keep processed preview in form state"]
  H --> E
  F -->|Yes| I{"Form valid?"}
  I -->|No| E
  I -->|Yes| J["Open review screen"]
  J --> K{"Confirm save?"}
  K -->|No| E
  K -->|Yes| L["Enter shared mutation state"]
  L --> M["Write asset and item in one transaction"]
  M --> N{"Transaction successful?"}
  N -->|Yes| O["Clear draft and show success"]
  N -->|No| P["Keep draft and show recoverable error"]
  O --> Q["Leave mutation state"]
  P --> Q
```

The draft and cropped image stay in UI memory until confirmation. The complete
source image is proportionally contained inside a fixed-height preview stage.
The preview image and crop bounds share the same explicit rendered rectangle,
so the complete source remains visible without horizontal scrolling. The user moves a crop rectangle
directly, changes its size with one slider, and switches its ratio with a
two-state portrait/landscape control. Those controls do not resize the stage.
Allowed crop ratios are portrait `1:sqrt(2)` and horizontal `sqrt(2):1`; the
generated JPEGs use fixed `560 x 792` or `792 x 560` output dimensions regardless
of source size or selected crop size.

Required entry fields use a neutral asterisk. Red warning indicators are
reserved for invalid input and persisted items that are missing required values.

Scheme-less web addresses are normalized to HTTPS and explicit HTTP addresses are
rejected. Two-option toggle fields have user-defined labels and always store
`true` or `false` for newly registered items. An unset value only exists when an
older item predates a newly added required field; the item list marks that
record as incomplete.

The editor applies the same domain validation used by persistence before opening
the review screen. Dates use four-digit years from `0001` through `9999`. Known
save failures show their actionable cause; browser-storage quota failures are
reported explicitly.

Closing the Add item dialog preserves an unfinished draft. **Clear all** uses a
two-click confirmation before discarding it. Closing the post-save success
screen is different: reopening Add item starts with a fresh draft rather than
returning to the previous Add another/Done screen.

Two-option fields are always required. Administration does not expose an
Optional setting for them. Legacy optional two-option definitions may be
upgraded to required without rewriting items; records that lack a value remain
visible with the same incomplete-item warning.

## Manage Fields

Status: implemented.

Use **Manage fields** in visible UI. Do not expose terms such as column, object
store, or schema migration to ordinary users.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A["Open Manage fields"] --> B["Choose goods type"]
  B --> C{"Choose action"}
  C -->|Add| D["Configure new field"]
  C -->|Modify| E["Edit supported metadata"]
  C -->|Delete| F["Confirm soft deletion"]
  D --> G["Stage change in memory"]
  E --> G
  F --> G
  G --> H["Review staged changes"]
  H --> I{"Apply changes?"}
  I -->|No| J["Discard staged changes"]
  I -->|Yes| K["Validate complete change set"]
  K --> L{"Valid?"}
  L -->|No| H
  L -->|Yes| M["Enter shared mutation state"]
  M --> N["Apply records in one transaction"]
  N --> O{"Transaction successful?"}
  O -->|Yes| P["Clear staged changes"]
  O -->|No| Q["Keep staged changes and show error"]
  P --> R["Leave mutation state"]
  Q --> R
```

Rules:

- staged changes exist only in memory
- one staged change is allowed per field
- built-in fields cannot be deleted
- `id` and `name` cannot become optional
- deleting a field preserves existing item values
- the complete staged set is validated before opening a transaction

The current UI supports text, long text, number, date, two-option toggle, web-address, and
selection-list fields. Internal keys are generated once and are not exposed to
ordinary users. Selection options receive stable IDs. Existing options may be
extended but not removed.

Safe initial modifications:

- rename a display label
- change required to optional
- change field position
- add select options without invalidating existing values

Deferred migrations:

- change field data type
- make a field required while existing values are empty
- change a stable field key
- remove select options used by existing items

## Reset Local Data

Status: implemented.

1. User opens Administration and chooses **Reset local data**.
2. The confirmation view explains which browser-local records will be removed.
3. User types `RESET` exactly.
4. Confirmation enters the shared mutation state and clears goods types, field
   definitions, items, and image assets in one transaction.
5. Navigation remounts in the clean empty state.

The operation does not remove theme settings, cached application files, or any
backup previously exported outside the application.

## Mutation State

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Ready
  Ready --> Busy : mutation starts
  Busy --> Ready : committed
  Busy --> Error : failed or aborted
  Error --> Ready : acknowledged or retried
```

When busy, the application disables conflicting mutations and keeps progress
visible. Harmless reading and navigation remain available when the active flow
can survive navigation safely.

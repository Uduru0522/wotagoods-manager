# Development Notes

## Running The App

```powershell
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:4173
```

Debug mode:

```text
http://localhost:4173?debug=1
```

The app can be opened directly through `index.html`, but the local server is preferred because manifest and service worker behavior are browser-origin dependent.

## Verification

Run the complete static and unit-test suite:

```powershell
npm run check
```

`npm run check` validates JavaScript syntax, browser import reachability,
dependency cycles and layer boundaries, referenced assets, and offline-cache
coverage, then runs the dependency-free `node:test` suite in `test/`.

After runtime or layout changes, start the server and verify:

- `http://localhost:4173`
- `http://localhost:4173?debug=1`

For persistence changes, create a goods type in each mode and reload:

- user-mode goods types must remain after reload
- debug-mode goods types must return to the fixtures after reload
- successful creation must open the new goods-type view
- a duplicate display name may warn but must not be blocked

For field-management changes:

- confirm protected fields have no edit or removal commands
- stage several additions, edits, removals, and order changes before applying
- confirm changing views discards unapplied staging without database writes
- reload after applying and confirm user-mode changes remain
- reload debug mode and confirm field changes return to fixtures

For item-registration changes:

- add values for every supported custom field type and review them before saving
- confirm scheme-less web addresses normalize to HTTPS and HTTP is rejected
- crop portrait and landscape images and confirm thumbnails survive reload
- confirm yes/no fields always produce one boolean value through a toggle
- confirm required values are enforced after whitespace normalization
- reload user mode and confirm saved items remain
- reload debug mode and confirm created items disappear
- confirm a failed save retains the item draft

## Browser Storage

Settings are stored in browser `localStorage`, not in project files.

Current keys:

```text
wotagoods.theme
```

Expected values:

```text
light
dark
```

In DevTools Console:

```js
localStorage.getItem("wotagoods.theme")
localStorage.removeItem("wotagoods.theme")
```

Collection data uses IndexedDB, not `localStorage`. User mode persists goods-type
creation in the browser database. Debug mode uses a separate writable in-memory
adapter and never opens or writes the user database.

Browser storage is origin-specific. These locations do not share settings or
IndexedDB data:

```text
http://localhost:4173/
https://uduru0522.github.io/wotagoods-manager/
```

Use versioned export/import to move a collection between origins, browsers, or
devices. Do not inspect or mutate IndexedDB directly from view modules.

## Adding A View

1. Add the definition in `src/views/view-definitions.js`.
2. Choose a `renderer` key.
3. If needed, add that renderer in `src/views/view-renderer.js`.
4. Add navigation metadata if it should appear in primary or utility navigation.

Keep route/view IDs stable. They are used by navigation state and router state.

## Adding A Goods Type For Debug Mode

Edit `GOODS_TYPE_FIXTURES` in `src/data/debug/debug-fixtures.js`.

Use stable IDs and domain-facing property names:

```js
{
  id: "example_goods",
  displayName: "Example goods",
  description: "Short description."
}
```

This is only debug data. `DebugStorage` clones these records and never writes them
to the user database.

## Theme Rules

Theme constants live in `src/app/config.js`.

Runtime theme changes are handled by `src/services/theme.js`.

First-paint theme is handled by `src/bootstrap/theme-bootstrap.js`. Keep that bootstrap file small and synchronous.

## CSS Rules

Main CSS lives in `src/styles/app.css`.

Prefer editing existing tokens before adding new hardcoded values. Important token groups:

- theme colors
- focus and accent tint colors
- scrollbar sizing
- navigation spacing
- motion timing

Keep interface motion subtle and at or below `200ms`. Use the shared
`--motion-phase`, `--motion-fast`, `--motion-enter`, and `--motion-layout` tokens
instead of component-specific durations. The static verification script enforces
this ceiling. New animation must also remain usable with the existing
`prefers-reduced-motion` override.

Stateful workflows should use `src/shared/content-transition.js`. One `--motion-phase`
is used before replacement and one after it, so their combined duration must remain
within the same `200ms` ceiling.

JavaScript fallbacks for CSS timing belong in `src/shared/motion.js`. Text action
buttons should use `src/shared/action-button.js` so default type and class behavior
remain consistent.

Responsive behavior currently has one breakpoint at `760px`, matching `APP_CONFIG.layout.narrowQuery`.

## Dependency Rules

- `src/shared/` may only import other shared modules.
- `src/data/` may only import data modules.
- `src/application/` may import application and data modules.
- Browser composition folders may combine these layers, but circular imports are
  rejected everywhere.

These constraints are enforced by `scripts/verify-static.js`.

## Drag Scrolling

Shared pointer drag behavior lives in `src/shared/drag-scroll.js`.

Current users:

- main view panel vertical scrolling
- wide navigation vertical scrolling
- narrow navigation horizontal scrolling
- schema table horizontal scrolling

Use the shared helper for new draggable scroll areas instead of adding local pointer logic.

Narrow navigation also uses `src/navigation/scrollable-row.js` for wheel-to-horizontal scrolling and right-edge scroll hints.

## Service Worker Updates

When moving or adding app files that must work offline:

1. Add the path to `service-worker.js`.
2. Bump `CACHE_NAME`.
3. Verify the moved file is served by the local server.

Docs are not currently cached by the service worker.

The worker checks for updates without the browser HTTP cache. It activates new
assets without automatically reloading an open page, so use a hard refresh when
validating a freshly deployed version.

# Architecture

Wotagoods Manager is intentionally dependency-free for now. The code is organized
so the app shell and IndexedDB boundary can stay stable while mutation workflows,
real forms, and item views are added.

## Runtime Flow

1. `index.html` loads `src/bootstrap/theme-bootstrap.js` before CSS. This applies the saved theme before first paint and prevents a light-mode flash.
2. `index.html` loads `src/styles/app.css`.
3. `src/main.js` imports `src/app/app-shell.js`.
4. `createApp()` creates the runtime mode, shell services, mutation controller,
   and startup coordinator.
5. `start()` initializes theme and shell behavior, selects the storage adapter,
   awaits storage initialization and goods-type loading, then creates views,
   navigation, and the router.
6. Startup storage failures render a retryable state instead of being interpreted
   as an empty collection.
7. Successful mutations ask the startup coordinator to reload goods types from
   the active adapter and rebuild data-dependent navigation without reopening the
   database.

## Module Boundaries

### `src/app/`

Owns application assembly and app-level behavior.

- `app-shell.js`: composition root and browser lifecycle owner.
- `app-runtime.js`: builds data-dependent views, navigation, renderer, and router.
- `app-elements.js`: required DOM lookup for shell elements.
- `app-mode.js`: user/debug mode detection.
- `config.js`: shared constants for selectors, theme, layout, and defaults.
- `layout-transition.js`: wide/narrow breakpoint transition state.
- `mutation-controller.js`: one global database-mutation lock and busy state.
- `startup-state.js`: storage loading and recoverable startup-error rendering.
- `startup-coordinator.js`: storage lifecycle, retries, and race-safe mounting.
- `view-router.js`: active view switching, title updates, and view transition timing.
- `view-scroll-state.js`: compact title-bar state based on view scroll position.

### `src/application/`

Owns storage-neutral use cases that coordinate domain records and adapter calls.

- `goods-types/create-goods-type.js`: constructs one goods type and its protected
  field definitions, then requests one atomic storage write.
- `fields/manage-fields.js`: validates staged field changes and converts them into
  field-definition records for one atomic adapter write.
- `data/reset-local-data.js`: requests one atomic clear of all user-data stores
  while leaving application metadata and external backups intact.
- `items/manage-items.js`: loads active field definitions, validates submitted
  values, constructs item records, and requests item persistence.

Application operations may depend on domain models and storage contracts. They
must not depend on DOM elements, IndexedDB object-store names, or view modules.

### `src/bootstrap/`

Contains scripts that must run before normal app startup. Keep this folder small.

- `theme-bootstrap.js`: reads `localStorage` directly and sets `data-theme` before CSS loads.

This duplicates a small part of `src/services/theme.js` on purpose. The service cannot run early enough to prevent first-paint theme flash.

### `src/data/`

Owns domain records, storage contracts, and persistence adapters. It is the
boundary between application operations and physical browser storage.

- `contracts/`: adapter capabilities and storage error definitions.
- `create-storage.js`: mode-aware adapter selection.
- `debug/`: in-memory debug fixtures and adapter.
- `indexeddb/`: physical schema, database lifecycle, and persistent adapter.
- `models/`: domain record construction and validation.

User mode opens the versioned IndexedDB database and persists created goods types.
Debug mode starts from hardcoded records, accepts the same creation operation in
memory, and never opens IndexedDB; its changes disappear on reload.

### `src/navigation/`

Owns navigation rendering and navigation-specific scroll behavior.

- `navigation.js`: combines primary and utility navigation.
- `primary-navigation.js`: dashboard, goods types, goods child views, administration.
- `utility-navigation.js`: Options gear in the app chrome.
- `nav-items.js`: nav button/separator builders.
- `scrollable-row.js`: horizontal scroll behavior for narrow navigation.

Navigation is data-driven through each view's `nav` metadata.
Vertical drag scrolling is shared through `src/shared/drag-scroll.js`.

### `src/services/`

Owns browser/platform services.

- `storage.js`: namespaced localStorage wrapper with safe fallbacks.
- `theme.js`: app theme controller and persisted theme changes.
- `service-worker-registration.js`: service worker registration.

### `src/shared/`

Generic helpers that should not know about Wotagoods-specific features.

- `dom.js`: small DOM creation helper.
- `action-button.js`: consistent construction of text action buttons.
- `content-transition.js`: reusable two-phase transitions for stateful workflow content.
- `drag-scroll.js`: reusable pointer drag scrolling.
- `icons.js`: icon creation.
- `motion.js`: CSS timing parsing and reduced-motion helpers.
- `ui-components.js`: reusable view components.

### `src/styles/`

Contains app-wide CSS. `app.css` currently holds design tokens, layout, view styling, responsive rules, scrollbar styling, and animations.

Important tokens:

- `--motion-phase`: one half of an exit/enter content transition.
- `--motion-fast`: fast UI state changes.
- `--motion-enter`: lightweight feedback when workflow content is replaced.
- `--motion-layout`: wide/narrow layout settle animation.
- `--scrollbar-*`: app scrollbar styling.
- `--focus-ring`: keyboard focus outline color.
- `--accent-tint`: low-emphasis icon background.
- `--nav-child-indent`: wide sidebar child-view indent.

### `src/views/`

Owns view definitions and view rendering.

- `view-definitions.js`: source of truth for view IDs, titles, sections, nav metadata, and renderer keys.
- `view-metadata.js`: shared constants for view IDs, nav groups, nav kinds, and renderer keys.
- `view-renderer.js`: renderer registry for dashboard, goods overview, items,
  administration, and options views.
- `administration/`: Administration rendering and the goods-type creation flow.
  Its field manager separates staging state, list rendering, editing, review, and
  orchestration into focused modules. Destructive local-data reset is isolated in
  its own typed-confirmation component.
- `items/`: collection item-list views and the modal item-entry workflow.
  Form generation, dialog orchestration, and list rendering remain separate so
  image processing can extend the draft without changing persistence UI.

## View Model

Each view definition has an `id`, title metadata, a renderer key, and optional navigation metadata.

Primary navigation uses:

```js
nav: { group: "primary" }
```

Goods-type parent views use:

```js
nav: { group: "primary", kind: "goods-type" }
```

The Items child view uses:

```js
nav: { group: "primary", kind: "goods-child", parentId: `goods:${goodsType.id}` }
```

Options uses:

```js
nav: { group: "utility" }
```

## Data Persistence

User mode uses IndexedDB through an application-owned storage contract.
Physical object stores remain stable; goods types, field definitions, and custom
values are records rather than generated database tables.

Current storage adapters:

- `IndexedDbStorage`: persistent browser-local user data.
- `DebugStorage`: in-memory fixtures that never write user data.

Views, navigation, and renderers must not import IndexedDB APIs or object-store
names. They consume plain domain records and call application operations. This
also keeps versioned file import/export and a future Google Drive snapshot adapter
independent from UI components.

See `docs/data-model.md` for domain records, `docs/persistence.md` for object
stores and transaction rules, and `docs/workflows.md` for mutation behavior.

### Persistence Integration Constraints

IndexedDB is asynchronous. The composition root selects the adapter from app
mode, awaits adapter initialization, and then loads goods types before constructing
data-dependent views and navigation. Startup renders an explicit loading state
and a recoverable storage-error state rather than silently treating a failed
database as an empty collection.

Mutation coordination belongs at application level. Individual views request an
application operation; they do not open transactions or independently manage
global busy state. `mutation-controller.js` prevents overlapping writes while
storage adapters provide transaction atomicity and return plain records or
domain errors.

## Service Worker

`service-worker.js` caches app shell assets for local-first behavior. When paths
change or cached app assets change, bump `CACHE_NAME` and update the asset lists.
Registration bypasses the HTTP cache when checking for worker updates. A newly
installed worker activates promptly, but the app does not force-reload an open
page because doing so could discard an in-progress draft.

The service worker intentionally lists module paths explicitly. That makes moved files visible during review and avoids hidden build steps.
